# FreeCad-Pyramids-and-polygons
FreeCad Workbench / Macros for building pyramids 
and polygons:
- tetrahedron
- hexahedron
- octahedron
- dodecahedron
- icosahedron
- truncated icosahedron (football)
- geodesic spheres (level 1 to 10)


# 2 versions
 - the first edition are macros. (the resulting parts are fully scalable)
 - the second edition is a workbench with fully scalable parts just like in the part workbench

# How to use the workbench
- Find the Macro folder via FreeCadMenu/Edit/Preferences/Macro ...
- Go to the 'Mod' folder, next to the 'Macro' folder
- expand the zip-file polyhedrons.zip
- (re)start FreeCAD
- The workbench 'polyhydrons' is now in the list, select it
- click on an icon, and proceed just like in the Part workbench.

# How to use the macros
- Find the Macro folder via FreeCadMenu/Edit/Preferences/Macro ...
- Put the macro-file(s) in that folder
- Goto FreeCadMenu/Macro/Macros, select the macro and execute it.
- The new pyramid.py is fully scalable (works similar to  Part Cone)
